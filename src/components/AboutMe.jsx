        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a frontend developer who's all about turning beautiful
        designs into working codes to give user the beautiful experience. My
        journey into coding started with a passion for problem-solving, but it
        was the magic of frontend development that truly stole my heart.<br/> </p>
        <p className="aboutText text-center max-w-3xl  text-lg">
          I am keen into developing websites using React.js with sprinkling in a dash
        of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to breathe life into designs. From tweaking
        stylesheets to fine-tuning animations, I'm all about those little
        details that make a big difference. And you can bet I've got TypeScript
        in my toolkit, adding that extra layer of stability to my projects.
      </p>
      <p className="aboutText text-center max-w-3xl  text-lg">
      I'm on the lookout for new opportunities to collaborate and bring my frontend expertise to the table. Let's team up and create some digital magic together! âœ¨
      </p>
